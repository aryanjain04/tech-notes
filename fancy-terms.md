# ðŸ“˜ Fancy Terms in Programming

A quick glossary of commonly used terms in software development and computer science.

---

### 1. **Idempotent**

An operation that, when applied multiple times, produces the same result every time.  
**Example:** Setting a value to `true` repeatedly doesn't change the outcome after the first time.

---

### 2. **Ephemeral**

Something that exists only temporarily.  
**Example:** Ephemeral servers like AWS Lambda exist only for the duration of their task and are destroyed afterward.

---

### 3. **Anonymous**

Functions defined without a name, often used as arguments to higher-order functions.  
**Example:** `lambda x: x + 1` in Python.

---

### 4. **Predicate**

A function that returns a boolean value â€” either `True` or `False`.  
**Example:** `is_even(n)` returns `True` if `n % 2 == 0`.

---

### 5. **Memoization**

An optimization technique that caches the results of function calls to avoid redundant computations.  
**Example:** Useful in recursive algorithms like Fibonacci to improve performance.

---

### 6. **Abstraction**

Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts.  
**Example:** Using a function like `sort()` without needing to know how the sorting is done internally.

---

### 7. **Serialization**

The process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted.  
**Example:** JSON or XML used to send structured data over the internet.
