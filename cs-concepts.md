# üß† CS Concepts ‚Äî One-Liner Notes

A curated list of core Computer Science concepts with brief, clear definitions.

### üíª Core Computing

- **Turing Machine**: A theoretical model that defines the limits of what can be computed.
- **Nibble**: A group of 4 bits (half a byte).
- **Machine Code**: Binary instructions directly executed by a CPU.
- **Kernel**: The core part of an operating system managing hardware and processes.
- **Shell**: Interface between the user and the OS (often command-line based).
- **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**: A text-based user interface to run commands.
- **Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)**: A protocol for securely accessing remote machines.
- **Mainframe**: High-performance, large-scale computers used for critical applications.

### üßæ Programming Languages & Execution

- **Interpreted Languages**: Code executed line-by-line by an interpreter (e.g., Python).
- **Compiled Languages**: Code translated into machine code before execution (e.g., C++).
- **Executable**: A compiled binary file that can be run by the OS.
- **Dynamically Typed Language**: Language where variable types are determined at runtime.
- **Pointer**: A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management that reclaims unused memory.

### üß† Data Structures & Algorithms

- **Hash/Map/Dict**: A key-value data structure for fast data lookup.
- **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure with nodes and edges.
- **Call Stack**: A stack structure storing function calls and local variables.
- **Stack Overflow**: An error caused by exceeding the call stack limit.
- **Divide and Conquer**: A strategy of breaking problems into subproblems and solving recursively.
- **Memoization**: Caching function results to avoid repeated computation.
- **Greedy**: An algorithm that builds up a solution step-by-step choosing the best option at each step.
- **Backtracking**: A recursive strategy to explore all possibilities and undo choices if needed.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Programming Paradigms

- **Declarative Paradigm**: Programming by describing _what_ to do, not _how_ to do it (e.g., SQL).
- **Functional Languages**: Emphasize immutability, pure functions, and recursion (e.g., Haskell).
- **Imperative Programming**: Programming by giving step-by-step instructions.
- **Procedural Languages**: Based on the concept of procedure calls (e.g., C).
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Based on objects, classes, and encapsulation.
- **Instantiate**: To create an actual object from a class.
- **Reference**: A variable that points to another object or memory location.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Systems & Architecture

- **Threads**: Lightweight units of execution within a process.
- **Parallelism**: Executing multiple tasks simultaneously to increase speed.
- **Concurrency Models**: Techniques to manage multiple computations at once (e.g., async, multithreading).
- **Bare Metal**: Software that runs directly on hardware without an OS.
- **Virtual Machine**: An emulated computer system running on top of real hardware.

### üåê Networking & Web

- **Network**: A group of interconnected devices that can share data.
- **IP Address**: A unique identifier for a device on a network.
- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: The address of a web resource.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names into IP addresses.
- **TCP Handshake**: A three-step process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish a connection.
- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**: Protocol for encrypted communication over a network.
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: The foundation of data communication on the web.
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules that lets programs communicate with each other.
